## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- HTML

### What I learned

- Reacquainted myself with CSS syntax.
- Remembered how to use flexbox to center a div.
- Can't believe I forgot how to link a page.
- Google fonts! 

### Continued development

It's been an while since I learned CSS and forgot most of it so I decided to give a basic challenge a go using Frontend Mentor. Turns out a didn't forget as much as I thought. 

I reacquainted myself with the syntax and it's concepts by Googling what I didn't know and trying to solve the problem as best I could.

While going through this excercise I discovered that all the effort I spent understanding the concepts of HTML and CSS paid off. I didn't remmeber many things when it came to syntax but thanks in large part to my time spent learning the basic theory I was able to satisfactorily complete the challenge with very little issue. 

### Useful resources

- I used google to find out specific syntax to accomplish what I needed to do.
